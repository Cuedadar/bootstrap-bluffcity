# Recreate Website with Basic JS

This project demonstrates my understanding of Bootstrap 5 in an attractive, one-page website.

**A live version of the site can be found at *[Netlify](https://jtking-bluffcity.netlify.app/)***

The website uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5 to create an example website for a construction company. Features include

- Responsive Images
- Bootstrap Form with Custom Validation
- Responsive Bootstrap Table
- Buttons and Breakpoint Visibility
- Bootstrap Navigation Bars
- Bootstrap scrollspy, cards, and carousel components

Also included are basic JS functions that operate on page load. That is the reason for the alert on page load.

The index.html is your starting point into the website. All other assets are grouped in the folder 'assets' and 'js'.

If I were to re-visit this project I would make some of the included example JS functions work. I would also like to consult the company to find out what kind of content they specifically would add on a site.
I'd also like each section to animate up into place as the user scrolls down.
